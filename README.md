# Labulator
## An R and Shiny-based tool for checking on our filter room.
Uses dropbox to access a file full of files. Because of the authentication scheme, the dropbox tokens cannot be shared. To see how to make your own dropbox tokens, check out [rdrop2's documentation](https://github.com/karthik/rdrop2).
